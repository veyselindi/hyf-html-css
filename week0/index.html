  the functionality of this page has priority over the design. Thats why you see this picture on the left :) </p> <br>

  <h3 class="heading3"> NISSAN 200SX </h3> 
  
  <img src="https://www.otopark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/800-hp-nissan-gt-r-engine-powers-insane-200sx-drift-car-105665_1.jpg" alt="Nissan 200SX" width="600" > 

  
  <div class="standardparagraph">
    The Nissan 200SX is a drifter’s top choice. It doesn’t really matter if you have an early S13 model (pop-up headlights) – any one would do. The S13 makes 180HP from the 1.8-liter turbo CA18DET motor, while the later S14 and S15 models use the 2.0-liter turbo SR20DET to deliver 200HP. Both are strong, easy to learn in, and have stacks of tuning parts available. The pick of the bunch has to be the S14 for the perfect compromise between budget and all-around performance. If money is no object, the looks of the S15 cannot be ignored. You can go sideways in style and look good while doing it.

  <div class="standardparagraph">
   The Mazda RX7 is notoriously difficult to drift if you’re a beginner, but absolute joy in the hands of a talented Drifter. It provides serious sideways pleasure. The car has great balance and the Wankel Rotary powerplant in turbo form makes enough power to smoke tires to their death – even though it’s only a 1300cc. The FD is the model of choice, but any of its predecessors will do.

  <div class="standardparagraph">
   The Supra is Toyota’s answer to the Nissan GT-R. The fact that it’s RWD makes us jump for joy because that means serious sideways action. There is plenty of poke on offer from the turbo straight six lump and minor mods will get you turning the weather form sunny to overcast in no time. It isn’t the lightest drift car around, but a healthy diet of stripping and bucket seats should see to that nicely.

  <div class="standardparagraph">
  Founded in 1929 by Enzo Ferrari, the company sponsored drivers and produced racing cars. Then, in 1947, Ferrari expanded onto road vehicles in an effort to fund its racing ventures. During this time, Ferrari was most successful in the Formula One circuit. In fact, Ferrari is the only team in existence to have consistently competed in the Formula One World Championship continuously since 1950. The company holds almost very Formula One record on the books nudging 15 World Driver Championship titles, 209 Grand Prix victories, 16 World Constructors Championship titles, 622 podium finishes, 203 pole positons, 218 fastest laps, 4925.27 points and 776 Grands Prix contested.

  <div class="standardparagraph">
  Founded in 1963, Automobili Lamborghini was originally a tractor business that utilized leftover military hardware for its construction. By 1955, the tractor company was one of the largest in Italy. The owner saw an opportunity to indulge in his passion for luxury cars and created Lamborghini. The first goal of this dynamic company was to perfect and promote the grand touring car. After several years of working with designers to develop the car, the Lamborghini 350GTV was born and revealed at the 1963 Turin Motor Show.  The rest, as they say, is history.

  Founded in 1914 as a Grand Prix car for Diatto, Maserati actually began producing street legal automobiles in 1957. The company has a vast history of reinvention and takeovers. Currently, Fiat Auto owns the company and combined it with Alfa Romeo in 2005. Maserati cars performed well at racing events throughout the 1940’s and 50’s. In 1939 and 1940, Maserati automobiles won the Indianapolis 500 which is the only Italian car producer in history to earn this distinction.

           Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. (Italian: [ˈalfa roˈmɛːo]) is an Italian luxury car manufacturer, founded by Frenchman Alexandre Darracq as A.L.F.A. ("[Società] Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili", "Anonymous Lombard Automobile Factory [Company]") on 24 June 1910, in Milan.[3] The brand is known for sporty vehicles and has been involved in car racing since 1911.
The company was owned by Italian state holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale between 1932 and 1986, when it became a part of the Fiat group.[4] In February 2007, the Alfa Romeo brand became Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A., a subsidiary of Fiat Group Automobiles, now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Italy.

           Fiat Automobiles S.p.A. (UK: /ˈfiːət, -æt/, US: /-ɑːt/; originally FIAT, Italian: Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino, lit. 'Italian Automobiles Factory, Turin') is an Italian automobile manufacturer, a subsidiary of FCA Italy S.p.A., which is part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (previously Fiat S.p.A.). Fiat Automobiles was formed in January 2007 when Fiat reorganized its automobile business,[2] and traces its history back to 1899 when the first Fiat automobile, the Fiat 4 HP, was produced.
Fiat Automobiles is the largest automobile manufacturer in Italy. During its more than century-long history, it remained the largest automobile manufacturer in Europe and the third in the world after General Motors and Ford for over twenty years, until the car industry crisis in the late 1980s.[3] In 2013, Fiat S.p.A. was the second largest European automaker by volumes produced and the seventh in the world, while currently FCA is the world's eighth largest auto maker.

  Groupe Renault (pronounced [ɡʁup ʁəno]) is a French multinational automobile manufacturer established in 1899.[6] The company produces a range of cars and vans, and in the past has manufactured trucks, tractors, tanks, buses/coaches and autorail vehicles.
According to the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles, in 2016 Renault was the ninth biggest automaker in the world by production volume.[2] By 2017, the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance had become the world's biggest seller of light vehicles, bumping Volkswagen AG off the top spot.[7]
Headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, the Renault group is made up of the namesake Renault marque and subsidiaries, Alpine, Automobile Dacia from Romania, Renault Samsung Motors from South Korea, and AvtoVAZ from Russia.[8][9] Renault has a 43.4% controlling stake in Nissan of Japan,[10] and a 1.55% stake in Daimler AG of Germany (since 2012, Renault manufactures engines for the Daimler's Mercedes A-Class and B-Class cars[11]). Renault also owns subsidiaries RCI Banque (automotive financing), Renault Retail Group (automotive distribution) and Motrio (automotive parts). Renault has various joint ventures, including Oyak-Renault (Turkey), Renault Pars (Iran). Carlos Ghosn is the current chairman and CEO. The French government owns a 15% share of Renault.

  Peugeot (UK: /ˈpɜːʒoʊ/, US: /puːˈʒoʊ/; French: [pøʒo]) is a French automotive manufacturer, part of Groupe PSA.[6]
The family business that preceded the current Peugeot company was founded in 1810,[7] and manufactured coffee mills and bicycles. On 20 November 1858, Émile Peugeot applied for the lion trademark. Armand Peugeot built the company's first car, an unreliable steam tricycle, in collaboration with Léon Serpollet in 1889; this was followed in 1890 by an internal combustion car with a Panhard-Daimler engine.[8] Due to family discord, Armand Peugeot founded the Société des Automobiles Peugeot, in 1896.
The Peugeot company and family are originally from Sochaux, France. Peugeot retains a large manufacturing plant and Peugeot museum there. In February 2014, the shareholders agreed to a recapitalisation plan, in which Dongfeng Motors and the French government each bought a 14% stake in the company.[9][10][11]
